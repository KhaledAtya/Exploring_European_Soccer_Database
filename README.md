# Exploring_European_Soccer_Database
The 1st project of Udacity's Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree.

The European Soccer Database contains data about 285 teams from 11 European leagues from season 2008/2009 to 2015/2016. These data contain game results, team attributes, and player attributes. Only game results and team attributes are considered for this analysis.

The following questions are to be investigated:

1) What team has the most wins and what attributes lead to that?
2) How did the top winning team perform over the available season range?
